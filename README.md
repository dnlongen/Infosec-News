# Infosec-News
Just a holding place for my security and threat news RSS list.
Import SecuritySources.opml into feedly.com, or your favorite RSS reader. It RSS feeds for ~150 blog and news sites, grouped into about 20 "must read," a handful of product security advisories, a handful of exploit sources, and a long list of everything else.
